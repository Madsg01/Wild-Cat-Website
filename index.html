          <p id="andeanp">The Andean cat is the most threatened felid in the Americas. Scientists estimate their total
            population is less than 1,400 animals and declining. Their distribution coincides with the historic range of
            the mountain chinchilla, which was hunted to the brink of extinction for the fur trade a century ago.
            Despite great concern regarding the status of the Andean cat, very little is known about its population
            structure, which is crucial data for appropriate management plans.

            main threat to the Bay Cat.<br>Wildlife traders are aware of the cat’s rarity, and they have been captured
            illegally from the wild for the skin and pet markets. Poaching of the cats’ prey species is a growing
            problem. There is legal protection of the Borneo Bay cat within Borneo, but enforcement to actually stop

          <p id="flatp">The flat-headed cat is primarily threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and
            degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations,
            draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting, and fishing. In addition,
            clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in tropical Asia. Flat-headed cats are
            very rare in captivity, with fewer than 10 individuals, all kept in Malaysian and Thai zoos.</p>
