            <p>Andean Mountain Cat</p>
          </a>
          <p id="andeanp">The Andean cat is the most threatened felid in the Americas. Scientists estimate their total
            population is less than 1,400 animals and declining. Their distribution coincides with the historic range of
            the mountain chinchilla, which was hunted to the brink of extinction for the fur trade a century ago.
            Despite great concern regarding the status of the Andean cat, very little is known about its population
            structure, which is crucial data for appropriate management plans.

            <p>Borneo bay cat</p>
          </a>
          <p id="borneop">The Bay Cat is found only on the island of Borneo, and appears to be widely distributed on the
            island. Outside of protected areas, habitat loss due to commercial logging and palm oil plantations is the
            main threat to the Bay Cat.<br>Wildlife traders are aware of the cat’s rarity, and they have been captured
            illegally from the wild for the skin and pet markets. Poaching of the cats’ prey species is a growing
            problem. There is legal protection of the Borneo Bay cat within Borneo, but enforcement to actually stop
            trade is minimal </p>

            <p>Flat-headed cat</p>
          </a>
          <p id="flatp">The flat-headed cat is primarily threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and
            degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations,
            draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting, and fishing. In addition,
            clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in tropical Asia. Flat-headed cats are
            very rare in captivity, with fewer than 10 individuals, all kept in Malaysian and Thai zoos.</p>

            <p>Iberian Lynx</p>
          </a>
          <p id="lynxp">The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild cat species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula in
            southwestern Europe. In the 20th century, the Iberian lynx population had declined because of overhunting,
            poaching, fragmentation of suitable habitats, and the population decline of its main prey species, the
            European rabbit.</p>

          <p id="tigerp">The tiger is an iconic species.In 2016, an estimate of a global wild tiger population of
            approximately 3,890 individuals was
            presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation.The WWF subsequently
            declared that the world's count of wild tigers had risen for the first time in a century.</p>
