Your Project's Name

Wild Cats Conservation Federation Website.

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

On this project i decided to make a charity website. I did not have any particular idea but i recently saw a documentary on wild cats and how endangered they where so that is where is got the inspiratio, i guess. I have never been good at this kind of stuff. Even as i sit here at 1:39 i am not happy but it is no use thinking about at this point i have about 60 hours left to get this done, minus sleep. 

If i was going to make something i thought it would be something that would atleast try to benefit people, or animals in this case. 

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Design process. I looked at several other charity websites that focus on the conservation of wild cats and saw what things they had. The first and most important aspect of a charity is the donation page. Since we are trying to raise money for a cause i determined that this was the number one most important part. A big button that says donate on every page. 

User story: As a person looking for a suitable charity i want to get information on what type of work the organisation does. 

I also want a place to donate. If i decide to make a contribution to the organisation i want that process to be as clear and easy to understand as possible. A big button.

I want to be able to recive updates on the organisations ongoing efforts. A newsletter. 

I want to be able to access information and to be able to make contact with the people behind the project easily. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

Link to wireframe. Link to user story. 

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

Feature one - Donation Button/form. Accessing the form to where one can make a contribution is possible everywhere as it is embeded in the navigational menu that sticks to the top of the page. 

Feature two - newsletter signup form. Same as the above, if a user finds themselves interessted in the project a button to signup to our newsletter can easily be acceses in the

Feature three - Gallery. Here is a section where people can see pictures of and get information on the animals and the staff. There are pictures and when you click on them they fold out and give you some information about a particular animal.

Additional features. 

Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

I used bootstrap framework for simplicity and to ease the time contraints. I did not have alot of time so i used the framework to ease on the amount of ccs that i needed to write. 

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.


Testing

Donate form works. Doesn't let you continue unitl you have filled out all the required fields. Although it does not connect to an external api that can process donations so for now it is just for show. Works as intended have tested it extensivly manually. 

Signing up to the newsletter works as it should although the case for this one is the same as the one above. 

Gallery the gallery section looks good on all devices and the links work.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment

I used github. Deployed it on pages. Run it locally on chromes, i use vscode. 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
