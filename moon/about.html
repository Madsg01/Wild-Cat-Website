        communities, governments and ordinary citizens. One of Panthera's plans, Tigers Forevers hopes to increase the
        Asian tiger population in select locations by 50 percent in 10 years and calls for monitoring tigers to
        prevent
        poaching, among other strategies.</p>

      </h3></a>
      <p style="font-size: 1vw;"> Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone, Minn. provides a haven for wild cats in need and
        works to change Americans
        attitudes about these animals. Unfortunately, many people who buy big cats for the sake of entertainment find
        out
        quickly that they are unable to care properly for these animals and end up sending them to sanctuaries. TWS
        acts
        as
        a no-kill nonprofit that provides a refuge for the rest of the cat's life. This sanctuary, unlike others, is
        not
        open to the public..</p>

      <p style="font-size: 1vw;">Wildlife Big Cats is a subgroup of the Wildlife Conservation Society focused on saving
        wildlife and wild places
        through science, education and conservation and by inspiring individuals about the value of big cats. The main
        cats it focuses on are tigers and lions, because they have suffered the highest amount of losses due to illegal
        poaching. WCS believes that breeding helps with the preserving and
        recover process for endangered species.</p>
